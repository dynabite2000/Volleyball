    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
    <p>
      Volleyball is a team sport played on a rectangular court. The objective is to send the ball over the net and land it within the opposing team's court, while preventing them from doing the same. The game is played in sets, and each set is won by the team that reaches 25 points first, with a minimum 2-point lead.

    <h2>Serving</h2>
    <p>
      Serving is the starting action of each rally. The server stands behind the end line and hits the ball with an open hand over the net to the opponent's court. There are different types of serves, including <span class="highlight">underhand serve</span> and <span class="highlight">overhand serve</span>.

    <h2>Passing</h2>
    <p>
      Passing, also known as the forearm pass, is used to receive the opponent's serve or to set up an attack. The player uses their forearms to direct the ball to their teammate. It requires good technique and proper footwork to accurately pass the ball to the target.

    <h2>Hitting</h2>
    <p>
      Hitting, or spiking, is an attacking action where a player jumps and hits the ball forcefully over the net, aiming to score a point. The hitter approaches the ball, leaps into the air, and uses an open hand to strike the ball downwards into the opponent's court.
